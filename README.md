# Pneumonia Detection with CheXNet and Grad-CAM 

This project uses **CheXNet (DenseNet121)** to classify chest X-ray images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**, and applies **Grad-CAM** to highlight the lung regions influencing the model's predictions.

## Features
- Fine-tuned DenseNet121 pre-trained on ImageNet
- Trained on chest X-ray datasets (e.g., Kaggle)
- Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretability
- Visualizations for training performance and evaluation

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC
- Classification Report
